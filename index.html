        <h2 class="head"> About Me : </h2>

        <p class="writing"> I'm in the 12th grade. I'm currently taking an intro to coding class and I am enjoying it. I have the passion to learn and I'm defiently going to take advantage of this learning process. I'm determined to become someone in the future and make a living by getting a job in computer science or programming.<br>
            <br> When I code, I feel smart. Sounds dumb but the final outcome makes me happy because I <strong> did </strong> something. I have the power to create what I want. Coding is interesting to me because there are...well... codes! <br>
            <br>I didn't realize it before but there was this game I use to play when I was young and when I went to edit my status / bio, I would have to actually code it in myself. So I've been coding since I was like 12, I didn't know what it was but I did it.
